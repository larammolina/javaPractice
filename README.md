Some methods that the CrudRepository interface offers us to enable CRUD functionality are:

    .findById(Integer id): allows you to query the database to find an instance of your model by its ID field
    .findAll(): allows you to retrieve ALL the entries in the database for a given model
    .save(Person p): allows you to create AND modify instances of your model in the database
    .delete(Person p): allows you to delete instances of your model from the database
